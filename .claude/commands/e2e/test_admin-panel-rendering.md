# E2E Test: Admin Panel Rendering Fix

## Steps to Validate

1. Run `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build -d admin` to start the admin panel.
2. Wait for service to be ready (check `docker logs proxyhub-rotor-pro-admin-1` for "Local:   http://localhost:4173").
3. Open browser to http://localhost:4173.
4. Verify the page loads without console errors (F12 > Console empty).
5. Confirm sidebar is styled (dark background, white text, icons visible).
6. Toggle theme in header - UI switches to dark mode (background darkens, text lightens).
7. On dashboard, verify KPI cards render with styled borders, text, and data (no unstyled HTML).
8. Check responsiveness: Resize window to mobile - sidebar collapses or hides, cards stack vertically.
9. Expected: No CSS errors in logs or console; full UI renders as expected.

## Expected Screenshots
- Full dashboard load in light mode: Shows layout with sidebar and cards.
- Dark mode toggle: Visual change to dark colors.
- Mobile view: Responsive layout.
